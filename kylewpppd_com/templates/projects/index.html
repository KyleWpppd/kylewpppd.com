  <h1>Things I've Made</h1>
  <p>From time to time, I enjoy making things. It's quite rewarding and
    I hope to do more of it. Below is some of the stuff I can share.</p>

    <h2>Project Euler</h2>
    <p class="project-lastupdated">Last Updated: 2011-03-01</p>
    <p class="project-leader">Project Euler is a site where people solve math
      problems with code.</p>

    <p>I often use Project Euler when I am trying to learn a new
    language. The problems are simple and straightforward enough to
    learn the basics, yet they get complex enough to learn language
    idioms.</p>
